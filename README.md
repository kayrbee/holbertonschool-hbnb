# About The Project

The `hbnb` project is a group assignment at Holberton which asks students to build our first full-stack application from scratch. The project is designed to evolve over 4 stages:

- [Part 1: Technical Documentation](part1/README.md)
- [Part 2: Implement API and Business Logic layer](part2/README.md)
- [Part 3: Implement authentication and a Database](part3/README.md)
- Part 4: Implement a web front-end (not started)

Each iteration of the project is contained in a separate subfolder so that we can track our progress.
