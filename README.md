# About The Project

The `hbnb` project is a group assignment at Holberton which asks students to build our first full-stack application from scratch. The project is designed to evolve over 4 stages:

- Part 1: Technical Documentation                 - Jump to [Part 1 README](/part1/README.md)
- Part 2: Implement API and Business Logic layer  - Jump to [Part 2 README](/part2/README.md)
- Part 3: Implement authentication and a Database - Jump to [Part 3 README](/part3/README.md)
- Part 4: Implement a web front-end (not started) - Jump to [Part 4 README](/part4/README.md)

Each iteration of the project is contained in a separate subfolder so that we can track our versions.
